fixlib
======

fixlib provides a Pythonic interface to build FIX engines. FIX messages
(currently, only version 4.2 of the protocol is supported) are converted
to very readable Python dictionaries. An abstract store interface is used
to store messages and thereby provide the resend facilities required by the
protocol. An example store based on CouchDB and couchdb-python is provided.
fixlib uses the asyncore module from the standard library to efficiently
handle network communication.


Requirements
============

 - setuptools (for easy running of tests)
 - python (tested on 2.6 only so far, should run on 2.5)
 - couchdb-python (if using the CouchDB store)


Further information
===================

fixlib is hosted on bitbucket.org. Bugs can be reported there.
views.dump contains the design documents needed for the CouchDB store.
